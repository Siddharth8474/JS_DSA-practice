    <!-- Debounce -->

<!-- Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a debounced version of that function.
A debounced function is a function whose execution is delayed by t milliseconds and whose execution is cancelled if it is called again within that window of time. The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.
For example, let's say t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 60ms, and 100ms.
The first 2 function calls would be cancelled, and the 3rd function call would be executed at 150ms.
If instead t = 35ms, The 1st call would be cancelled, the 2nd would be executed at 95ms, and the 3rd would be executed at 135ms. -->

       function dbounce(fn,t){
        let timeoutid;
          return function(...args){
          clearTimeout(timeoutid);
          timeoutid = setTimeout(() => {
            fn(...args)
          },t)
          }
       }

       let fun = dbounce(console.log,1000);
       fun('call 1');
       fun('call 2')
       fun('call 3')
